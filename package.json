    "description": "Amazon Redshift  Overview \n\nThis is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation\nfor one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage\nAmazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means\nthat some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous\ncallback handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this\nreference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied\nimmediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window.\nFor a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to Using\nthe Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html].\n\nAmazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a\ndata warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster,\nand applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus\non using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.\n\nIf you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by\nreading the Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html].\n\nIf you are a database developer, the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html] explains how to\ndesign, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data\nwarehouse.",
